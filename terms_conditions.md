## Dataset Usage Terms and Conditions

*Last updated:  May 15, 2017*

Thank you for your interest in the Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017!  These Dataset Usage Terms and Conditions (“Dataset Terms”) govern your use of the Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017 (the “Dataset”), and are entered into by you and Maplebear Inc. dba Instacart, a Delaware corporation. 
By downloading, utilizing or otherwise accessing the Dataset, you agree to be bound by these Dataset Terms, the general [Instacart Terms of Service](https://www.instacart.com/terms) and the [Instacart Privacy Policy](https://www.instacart.com/privacy).  If you later decide to enter into a competition or other event sponsored by Instacart (whether hosted by Instacart or a service provider of Instacart) with respect to the Dataset (an “Event”), you agree to also be bound by the terms and conditions applicable to that Event.  If you do not agree to be so bound, then you may not download, utilize, or otherwise access the Dataset.  The Dataset shall be considered part of the “Services” as defined in the Instacart Terms of Service.  For the avoidance of doubt, these Dataset Terms shall be in addition to your obligations under the Instacart Terms of Service, the Instacart Privacy Policy, and, if applicable, the Event terms and conditions.   In the event of any conflict between the Instacart Terms of Services, the Instacart Privacy Policy, the Event terms and conditions and these Dataset Terms with respect to the Dataset, these Dataset Terms will govern.

### INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

You may only use the Dataset as-is and only for non-commercial purposes.  You may only use the Dataset for the purposes stated herein or in any Event subject to the terms and conditions therein and for the duration that the Dataset is available on this site, including but not limited to reading and learning from the Dataset, analyzing the Dataset, modifying the Dataset, and generally preparing your submission for any Event.  You will not provide, transmit or make available the Dataset to any third party and you agree to use suitable measures to prevent persons who have not formally agreed to these Dataset Terms from gaining access to the Dataset. You agree that you will not use the Dataset for improper or unlawful means, including but not limited to, attempting to identify or re-identify any individual through the Dataset. You agree to notify Instacart immediately upon your learning of any possible unauthorized transmission, unauthorized access, or any problems discovered in the Dataset and agree to work with Instacart to rectify any such issue.  You acknowledge and agree that as between you and Instacart, the Dataset is the sole and exclusive property of Instacart, including, but not limited to, all intellectual property rights embodied therein.  You agree that the fact that Instacart has provided you with access to the Dataset in accordance with the Dataset Terms shall not be construed as having or being granted a license (expressly, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise) under, or any right of ownership in, any of the Dataset.  

### DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

The Dataset is provided to you on an “as is” basis and Instacart hereby disclaims any and all warranties with respect to the Dataset, whether express, implied, or statutory.    Instacart hereby disclaims any and all liability for any and all damage or loss to any system or otherwise resulting from accessing, reading, or downloading the Dataset. 

### RIGHT TO CANCEL OR MODIFY
